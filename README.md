## Contents

 - data_processing.py: program to import, clean, explore and prepare data
   for a supervised ML project. Adapted for the project to predict if a school project will be funded.
 - classifiers.py: program to build, train and evaluate different type of Classifiers.
 - clustering_pipeline.py: program to import, clean, make clusters, and explore their characteristcs. Adapted for the project to predict if a school project will be funded.
 - [Report_ml_pipeline.pdf](https://github.com/angelicavi/capp_ml_spring2020/blob/master/Report_ml_pipeline.pdf "Report_ml_pipeline.pdf") the final report of a project using data_cleaning and classifiers.py to predict if school project will not be fully funded within 60 days.
  - [Report_clustering.pdf](https://github.com/angelicavi/capp_ml_spring2020/blob/master/Report_clustering.pdf "Report_clustering.pdf") the final report of clustering a project using to cluster and analize whole dataset of school projects and the projects predicted from the supervised ML project.
